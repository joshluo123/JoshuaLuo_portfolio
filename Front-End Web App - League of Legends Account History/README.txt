A front-end web application showing an account overview for an account (Ramen N00dIes) in the computer game League of Legends.

Each page features a 'League of Legends' logo that links to the game's official web page, the name of the player's account being viewed, and a navigation bar to go to each web page of the app.

The 'Home' page features a rotating carousel of the player's top five most played champions. Arrows on the left and right sides of the carousel allow the user to more quickly scroll through the carousell. Clicking on the champion names or pictures will navigate the user to the 'Top 5 Champions' page. There is also a space for the user to send the player a message (non-functional) via a POST request.

The 'Top 5 Champions' page features a table that displays statistics on the user's performance on five champions corresponding to those on displayed on the 'Home' page. There is also a 'Download Statistics' button that provides an image of the table for download.

The 'Rank' page features statistics on the player's current rank and some performance statistics in ranked matches.

The 'Match History' page features a scrolling table of the players 10 most recent games. Each game is highlighted green or red to quickly indicate whether the player won or lost that game. Each game also contains information about the player's performance, such as champion played, game type, and the player's score.
